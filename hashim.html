            So how did this type of communication come about? 
            <li>The first version of an email came about during 1965 at MIT. As a part of the university's Compatible Time-Sharing System, files and messages could be chared after logging in from remote terminals.</li>
            <li>In 1971, Ray Tomlinson suggested to Arpanet (a part of the United States Department of Defence) that letters could be sent between different computers. He also suggested an @ symbol which could target specfic users. Tomlinson sent the first email.</li>
            <li>The email became a standard in 1973 and more features are added such as forwarding emails.</li>
            <li>In 1976 the Queen sends her first email on Arpanet.</li> 
            <li>In 1978 Eric Schmidt develops BerkNet. He would later go on to oversee the introduction of Gmail.</li>
            <li>Shiva Ayyadurai writes a program called EMAIL for the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, at the age of 14.</li>
            <li>Microsoft Mail is introduced in 1988 for MacOS.</li>
            <li>Hotmail and Yahoo launch between 1996 and 1997.</li>
            <li>With the launch of the iPhone in 2007, emails could now be accessed on a touch screen handheld device.</li>
