      <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Computer Science contributions to society</strong></h3>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: center;">There are a number of contributions computer science has offered to the world which resulted in positive innovation. One example of this is with the <strong>environment</strong>. It first started with bottle deposit schemes. These schemes offered those who bought bottled drinks which were plastic to return them for recycling purposes. This way, those who return their bottles only pay for the beverage and not the plastic bottle itself. These schemes are popular in mainland Europe, but very abundant in Germany.</p>

        <h5 style="text-align: center;">How does it work?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Each bottle label has a special bottle recycling logo.</li>
          <li>Once a bottle is inserted into the machine, the machine scans the barcode and the dimensions of the bottle to certify that the bottle is recyclable.</li>
          <li>After all bottles have been deposited and the depositor confirms this, a voucher is printed off to cash out for money. In Plochingen, Germany it is 25Â¢ per bottle.</li>
        </ul>

      <p style="text-align: center">In England and Wales, this system is to come into effect <strong>by the end of 2023</strong>. The technology used to  but that is not where it stops.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center">However, this isn't anywhere near the extent computer science has made a positive contribution for the world. Raspberry Pi kits are being used by recycling teams all over the world to slowly help differentiate between recyclables and landfill waste which are sometimes thrown in the same bin. The differentiation process is conducted by robots. However, since this is only a recent innovation in environmental technology,  it is quite a slow process. So much so,  that humans are faster in processing recycling than the automated robots.</p>
