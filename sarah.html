      <h3>Forecasting Outbreaks</h3>                                                                <!--put relevent image here-->
      <p>Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly good at flagging the epicentre of novel viruses.
          In the case of the corona virus pandemic Canadian start-up BlueDot spotted the first covid cases 9 days before the World Health Organisation released its report.
          The same AI previously detected the Zika virus in Florida in 2016.
      </p>
      <h3>Developing drugs and treatments</h3>                                                                                     <!--article goes here-->
      <p>Artificial intelligence has also been utilised to search for COVID-19 treatments.
           In January researchers at BenevolentAI, London, discovered that a drug that is already established for treating rheumatoid arthritis may also be effective treating covid-19.
           A clinical trial of the drug is now taking place in Manchester,
           if successful the drug could be administered to the most serious Covid patients with hope that it will ease the effect of the virus on the lungs.
      </p>
      <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
      <p>Recently some MIT researchers have been using AI to detect corona virus in asymptomatic people.
          People with Covid-19 appear to cough differently to people without the virus. The difference is not distinct enough to be discernable to the human ear but can be
          picked up by artificial intelligence. This discovery is important as asymptomatic people are far less likely to get a test meaning if there was a screening method as straight forward as recording yourself
          coughing on a smart phone, many less people would unknowingly spread the disease. </p>
